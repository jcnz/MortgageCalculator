# MortgageCalculator
This was build as an educational demo to see how Powerapps Component Framework can be stretched to do something similar as a CRM web resource.

Pre-requisites
1. Ensure npm is installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository to your machine.
3. Browse to the repository using a command terminal. I used VS Code which comes with a built-in terminal window.
4. Run "npm install" to install the node dependencies.
5. Run "npm run start" to build the project. It should launch a browser window.
